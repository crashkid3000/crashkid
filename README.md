My own website, awesome!

## Runs on
 - Wagtail 2.8 (+ dependencies coming from that)
 - MySQL database
 - pythonanywhere.com

## What this actually does
This GitHup repo doesn't _actually_ contain my website. As it is a Wagtail (and at it's core a Django) project, all you can see here is really just the templates and data models for my website. If you _really_ want to clone/fork this, you will have to setup and migrate the database by yourself. However, I _highly_ discourage you from doing that as this project also contains a lot of not so nicely hard-coded stuff that, at this point in time, I do not know how to refactor to make it more easily configurable for other projects.

## So, why is this even publicly available on GitHub then?
Because it makes it easier for me to show others what/how I have created this website - think job interviews, for example. ᵖˡᵉᵃˢᵉ ʰᶦʳᵉ ᵐᵉ
